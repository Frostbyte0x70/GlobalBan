# GlobalBan
GlobalBan is a Discord bot that can be used to issue bans across multiple servers. It's useful if you moderate a group of servers or a community that might want to share certain bans across all servers.

Its main features are:
- **Global bans**: Ban a user on a given server and send a ban request to all other servers the bot has been added to.
- **Trust list**: Each server keeps its own list of trusted servers. If a trusted server issues a global ban, it is automatically replicated on the server. If a non-trusted server issues a global ban, an alert message that allows applying it mannually is sent insetead.
- **Global alerts**: Servers can issue alerts about users to watch out for that will be received by all the servers the bot has been added to.
- **Whitelist**: The host of the bot manually determines which servers it can be added to.
